                <h2>The Mystery of the Great Fire</h2>
                <p>One of the most persistent myths in history is that a single catastrophic fire destroyed the Great Library. In reality, its decline was likely a slow process spanning centuries. Various events contributed to its disappearance: Julius Caesar's fire during the Siege of Alexandria in 48 BCE, the decree of Emperor Theodosius I in 391 CE, and the eventual Arab conquest in 642 CE. However, modern historians believe that the biggest enemy of the library was not fire, but time and budget cuts.</p>
                <p>As the Roman Empire became more unstable, funding for the Mouseion dried up. Without scholars to copy the scrolls, the papyrus simply rotted away. This loss of information created a "knowledge gap" that some believe delayed the scientific revolution by nearly a thousand years. Imagine where humanity might be today if the medical and astronomical texts of Alexandria had never been lost.</p>

                <h2>The Bibliotheca Alexandrina</h2>
                <p>In 2002, the spirit of the ancient library was reborn. The new <em>Bibliotheca Alexandrina</em> stands near the site of the original. It is a massive, sun-drenched disk tilting toward the sea, covered in inscriptions from all the world's known alphabets. It serves once again as a center for research, culture, and science, housing millions of books and specialized museums. It is a bridge between the ancient world and the digital age.</p>

                    "The library is a mirror of the universe. To rebuild it is to rebuild our hope in human progress."

                <h3>How Alexandria Lives On</h3>
                <p>The legacy of the library isn't just in buildings, but in how we organize our lives today. Every time you use an index in a book, look at a map, or go to a university, you are participating in a tradition started in Alexandria. The library established the concept of "Public Knowledge"—the idea that the state should support the pursuit of truth for the benefit of all people.</p>
