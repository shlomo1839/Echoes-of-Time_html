            <h2>Tangible History</h2>
            <p>While the building itself is gone, the tools, technologies, and physical remnants of that era tell
                a story of incredible sophistication. From the way they recorded information to the instruments they
                used to navigate the seas, the artifacts of Alexandria were far ahead of their time. The city was a
                manufacturing hub for the primary medium of the ancient world: Papyrus.</p>

            <h2>Artifact Deep Dive</h2>
            <p>The library used specific tools to organize and protect its vast wealth. Scholars have identified several key
                items that defined the daily life of an Alexandrian intellectual.</p>
            
            <section id="items">
                <details>
                    <summary>1. The Pinakes (The Catalog)</summary>
                    <p>Callimachus created the <em>Pinakes</em>, a 120-volume bibliographical survey of the library's contents.
                        It wasn't just a list; it included biographical sketches of authors and summaries of their works. It was
                        the "Google Search" of the 3rd century BCE.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>2. The Astrolabe</summary>
                    <p>A sophisticated handheld model of the universe. Scholars in Alexandria used it to tell time, determine latitude,
                        and predict the positions of stars. It was essentially an ancient analog computer.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>3. Papyrus and Ink</summary>
                    <p>Made from the pith of the papyrus plant found along the Nile, these scrolls were the iPads of their day.
                        Scribes used reeds and carbon-based ink (lampblack mixed with gum) to record everything from tax records to the epic poems of Homer.</p>

        <section id="preservation">
            <p>The preservation of these artifacts was a constant battle. Papyrus is organic and decays easily.
                The library employed professional "book doctors" who used cedar oil to ward off insects and carefully re-rolled damaged
                manuscripts to ensure they would survive for future generations. It is thanks to these meticulous efforts that any
                fragments of ancient wisdom survived at all.</p>
