            <h2>The Minds that Shaped History</h2>
            <p>The Great Library was not just a collection of books; it was a collection of people. Scholars were given tax exemptions,
                free room and board, and a salary just to think and write. This "intellectual incubator" produced breakthroughs that
                 wouldn't be surpassed for over a thousand years.</p>

            <h3>Eratosthenes: The Man Who Measured the Earth</h3>
            <p>Eratosthenes of Cyrene, the third head librarian, was a polymath. His most famous achievement was calculating the circumference
                of the Earth with startling accuracy using nothing but shadows and geometry. By measuring the angle of the sun at noon in two
                different cities (Syene and Alexandria), he deduced that the Earth must be a sphere and calculated its size within a few percentage
                points of the modern value.</p>
            <p>Beyond geography, Eratosthenes also created a system for finding prime numbers, known as the Sieve of Eratosthenes,
                which is still taught in computer science and math classes today. His life proves that the library was a place of
                practical, scientific discovery, not just abstract theory.</p>

            <h3>Euclid: The Father of Geometry</h3>
            <p>Euclid lived in Alexandria during the reign of Ptolemy I. His work, <em>The Elements</em>, is one of the most influential
                books in human history. It served as the primary textbook for teaching mathematics (especially geometry) until the early
                20th century. In the library's halls, Euclid established the axiomatic method, proving that complex truths could be derived
                from simple, self-evident assumptions.</p>

            <h3>Hypatia: The Last Light</h3>
            <p>Hypatia was a philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician who taught at the library during its final centuries.
                She was a symbol of the intellectual tradition of Alexandria. Her tragic death at the hands of a mob is often
                seen by historians as the end of the Classical era. She edited major works on conic sections and constructed
                astrolabes, keeping the flame of science alive in an increasingly turbulent world.</p>
